# arachas

Arachas is a web crawler that is capable of extracting card data related to the GWENTÂ®: The Witcher Card Game from community websites.
Currently it only crawl the popular [gwentify](http://gwentify.com/) website.

The extracted data is then saved in a json file. It's also capable of downloading the card images but it will not do it by default.

Arachas have rudimentary diff capabilities which allow a user to keep track of what changed between consecutive runs.
It will print a message if a card was added/removed or modified (it can't make the distinction by itself).
